Parser:
    Unit
    null? (void?)
    VarOrEmptyString(null?) expression (?Varname)
    REPL ParseMode
    wildcards (custom?)

Runtime:
    VarOrEmptyString(null?) expression (?Varname)
    Function overloads
    when executing scripts, cwd should be the directory of the script (also for imports)
    private definitions | explicit exports
    wildcards (custom?)
    events?

REPL:
    autocompletions
    correctly handle ctrl + c
    better error handling
    ignore empty inputs (instead of throwing a parse error)

NativeFs:
    prog: calls a program instead of a function (eg. `prog ls` to call `ls` without colors)
    fun: calls a function instead of a program

ToFix:
    implicit stdlib imports for scripts
    import errors should show the module that the function was imported from
        (Also: stacktrace? (at least 'module trace'))

???:
    `someProgram a >> x` does not execute `someProgram`. You have to do `{someProgram a} >> x`
